A few things I am probably planning to do, but no promises.

  - [ ] pause the scope
  - [ ] wavelength info on the scope
  - [ ] add the real colors for scope
  - [ ] reference spectrum (load a known for calibration)
  - [ ] spectrum value correction (make the current spectrum match the reference using multipliers)
  - [ ] multiple profiles
  - [ ] reconstructed color from the spectrum shown
  - composite shots
    - [ ] add a second capture window and put the spectrum on it
    - [ ] use the user specified camera (even the same one (can be useful if the scope is paused))
  - [ ] save the spectrum
  - [ ] load the spectrum (in paused mode? for reference?)
