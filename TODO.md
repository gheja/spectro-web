A few things I am probably planning to do, but no promises.

  - [ ] save settings to local storage and load them on start
  - [x] pause the scope
  - [x] wavelength info on the scope
  - [x]] add the real colors for scope
  - [x] reference spectrum (load a known for calibration)
  - [/] spectrum value correction (make the current spectrum match the reference using multipliers)
  - [ ] multiple profiles
  - [ ] reconstructed color from the spectrum shown
  - composite shots
    - [ ] add a second capture window and put the spectrum on it
    - [ ] use the user specified camera (even the same one (can be useful if the scope is paused))
  - [ ] save the spectrum
  - [ ] load the spectrum (in paused mode? for reference?)
  - [ ] load source from video upload
  - [ ] load source from picture upload
  - [ ] load source from clipboard
  - [ ] add some padding to the right side of the setup page so can be scrolled more easily on touch screen
