A few things I am probably planning to do, but no promises.

  - [_] pause the scope
  - [_] wavelength info on the scope
  - [_] add the real colors for scope
  - [_] reference spectrum (load a known for calibration)
  - [_] spectrum value correction (make the current spectrum match the reference using multipliers)
  - [_] multiple profiles
  - [_] reconstructed color from the spectrum shown
  - composite shots
    - [_] add a second capture window and put the spectrum on it
    - [_] use the user specified camera (even the same one (can be useful if the scope is paused))
  - [_] save the spectrum
  - [_] load the spectrum (in paused mode? for reference?)
