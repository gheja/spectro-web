A few things I am probably planning to do, but no promises.

  - [ ] test video showing CFL, incandescent, etc
  - [ ] save settings to local storage and load them on start
  - [x] pause the scope
  - [x] wavelength info on the scope
  - [x] add the real colors for scope
  - [x] reference spectrum (load a known for calibration)
  - [/] spectrum value correction (make the current spectrum match the reference using multipliers)
  - [x] smoothing of wave by overlaying multiple frames
  - [ ] add warning about clipping source (RGB) values
  - [ ] multiple profiles
  - [ ] reconstructed color from the spectrum shown
  - composite shots
    - [ ] add a second capture window and put the spectrum on it
    - [ ] use the user specified camera (even the same one (can be useful if the scope is paused))
  - [ ] save the spectrum
  - [ ] load the spectrum (in paused mode? for reference?)
  - [ ] auto corss-reference the current spectrum to stored/reference ones, display the match if strong match
  - [ ] load source from video upload
  - [ ] load source from picture upload
  - [ ] load source from clipboard
  - [x] add some padding to the right side of the setup page so can be scrolled more easily on touch screen
  - [x] wavelength markers
  - [ ] custom wavelenth markers, editing them
  - [ ] bug: start and end coordinates in Inspect scope drawing are fixed to corners, weird display
  - [ ] make SCOPE_WIDTH and SAMPLE_COUNT independent (scope rendering now does not scale the data)
  - [ ] make SCOPE_HEIGHT adjustable (scope rendering now uses the pixel value 0..255 directly which works with 300 px height)
  - [ ] auto peak detection and wavelength markers for peaks
  - [ ] messages when (auto)changing scope modes
